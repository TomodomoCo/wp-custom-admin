**Code samples that will help bend the WordPress admin panel to your will.**

These should be placed in a `functions.php` file, a plugin, or a must-use plugin. Decide at your own discretion.

If you have your own cool code samples to submit, add them to the appropriate file and submit a pull request. I'd love to see this repository grow.

Please include a PHP docblock following this format:

```php
/**
 * function my_function_name
 * Your function in a nutshell
 *
 * Optional longer description; this can span multiple
 * lines but please be kind and wrap them manually.
 *
 * @author Your Github user name, if you're contributing new code
 * @link A URL, if you're contributing an existing snippet
 */
```

Please make sure to keep your code within the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/coding-standards/). It keeps things legible and more consistent as this code gets moved between projects.
